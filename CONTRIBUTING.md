# Welcome to Laureate contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [Laureate](https://laureate.netlify.app/) :sparkles:.

In this guide, you will get an overview on how to contribute, open issues, open a PR, review and merge it.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). The README contains everything you need to get yourself started with your contributions to our Open Source Project.

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot any bugs with the existing code / contributions, head over to the **Issues** section and make sure the issue / bug is not already in the list of open issues. If you do not find the issue you want to report, you can open a new issue, by clicking on the **New Issue** button and filling up the form with the relavant information.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/subhoghoshX/laureate/issues) to find one that interests you. You can assign to you, any issue that is open and start working on it.
After you have solved an issue, open a Pull Request for review.

### Make Changes

For any changes you make, be it solving an existing / new Issue, or contributing a new feature, make sure you:

- Fork the repository, if not already done.
- Ensure the base branch of your repository is in sync with that of the OS project.
- Create a new branch in your forked repository, specifically for the task you are doing.
- Clone the newly created branch from your repository to your local enviroment, perform the initial setup in the [README](README.md) and start working on your change.

### Commit your update

After you've made your changes, make sure to self review to verify its working, and commit the changes once you are happy with them, with an appropriate commit message.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, and have commited the same, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Head over to your repository and branch you want to merge. Click on **Contribute** and select **Open pull request**.
- Fill the form with a title relavant to the changes / additions that you're making, and add a relevant description and create a pull request.
- Be sure to check out the PR later, as we may request that you do some changes, before we merge the PR. The details of what needs to be changed can be found as comments in the PR.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations), or add relavent comments to indicate the changes made.

Congratulations :tada::tada: Now you're part of the [Laureate Community](https://github.com/subhoghoshX/laureate/). Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [Laureate](https://laureate.netlify.app/).
